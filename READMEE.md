# GOAL
The goal of this webpage is to to make a simple and easy to understand scheduler. One that saves your plans under the appropriate hour. And one that tracts the time you made your plans in from real time.


## CLIENTELE
This page is made for people who need to better organize their time, and want to save tasks for hours later, or a specific time the next day. The plans will stay until deleted.


## PROCESS
My process of the code was to start with the html sections and match them up to the example image. Using mainly bootstrap code (class), to style the elements I started with individual sections and then worked my way to connecting them properly to react with each-other. I then started on my JavaScript code, I connected the current date and time to the top of the page and then hit a wall. I struggled with my JS code for hours. I looked through many other example codes, classmates code, watched videos to explain jquery, bootstrap, and many other useful information. I found a code that made the most sense to me while still containing confusion for knowledge sake and then I re wrote it to force myself to better understand.
